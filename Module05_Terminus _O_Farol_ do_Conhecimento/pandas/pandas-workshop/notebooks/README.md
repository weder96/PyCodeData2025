# Workshop Notebooks

This directory contains the notebooks for following along with the session. You should run the cells as we progress through the session. Each section contains exercises, which you should complete in the `workbook.ipynb` notebook.

| Section | Notebook |
| --- | --- |
| 0: Setup | `0-check_your_env.ipynb` |
| 1: Getting Started With Pandas | `1-getting_started_with_pandas.ipynb` |
| 2: Data Wrangling | `2-data_wrangling.ipynb` |
| 3: Data Visualization | `3-data_visualization.ipynb` |
| 4: Hands-On Data Analysis Lab | `4-hands_on_data_analysis_lab.ipynb` |


**NOTE**: The `check_env.py` file will be used only in `0-check_your_env.ipynb`, which you will use to check your setup. The `utils.py` file contains a function for configuring our plotting backend.
